If you are subscribed to BAnQ (Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec) and you forget to return your borrowed items in time, this app is for you !
My BAnQ allows you to :
* list your borrowed items
* receive notifications when the return date is approaching
* renew your borrowed items
* add several BAnQ accounts

This app is open source and under the GPL v3 license; it is developed by Anthony Dahanne and Guilhem de Miollis, hoping that it will be as useful to you as it is for us !
